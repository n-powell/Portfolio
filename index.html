              I come from a background of creating and experimenting. As a child I would take apart anything I could get my hands on. In the third grade we were tasked to build a valentines box to exchange cards with students. They suggested a shoe box, I made a box made from fence <span id="tools">wood panels, nails, a door hindge, and finished it with a thick coat of white house paint.</span> A shame the paint didnt dry by the next day for Valentines, but that was my first experience building something I was passionate about and realising that just when you think your'e finished, it may still not be ready.

              My drive and desire to learn at <strong>EPICODUS</strong> comes from many years of tech hardware experience and pc building. Afer recieving an <em>Assosiates of Science</em> for Information Systems, I began experimenting with pc hardware and building gaming/entertainment computers for myself and friends.
