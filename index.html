            <p>
              I come from a background of creating and experimenting. As a child I would take apart anything I could get my hands on. In the third grade we were tasked to build a valentines box to exchange cards with students. They suggested a shoe box, I made a box made from fence <span id="tools">wood panels, nails, a door hindge, and finished it with a thick coat of white house paint.</span> A shame the paint didnt dry by the next day for Valentines, but that was my first experience building something I was passionate about and realising that just when you think your'e finished, it may still not be ready.
